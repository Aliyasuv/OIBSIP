Unemployment Analysis in India:
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of unemployment rates in India, leveraging data science techniques to uncover insights and trends. 
The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model using linear regression. 
Visualizations are created to highlight trends over time, regional disparities, and correlation factors. 
The project also features a Flask API for deploying the predictive model, allowing for dynamic unemployment rate predictions.
